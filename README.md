## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- 


### Continued development

In future projects, I wish to add more interactivity to the website, maybe with dark mode as well as the ability for the user to copy a link to their clipboard as well. As for CSS, I struggled on the usage of media queries, ultimately opting out of using one, and deciding about how to make the height responsive (Spoiler: It isn't.).
